General LaTeX tips:

Use "$ ... $" for inline equations
Use "\[ ... \]" for equations on their own line
Use "\begin{center} ... \end{center}" to center something
Use "\includegraphics[width=?cm]{filename.eps}" for images - must compile to dvi then use dvipdfm from a batch file
Use "\begin{multicols}{2} ... \end{multicols}" for two columns
Use "\begin{enumerate} \item ... \end{enumerate}" for parts of physics exercises
Use "\section*{ }" for sections without numbering
Use "\begin{cases} ... \end{cases}" for piecewise functions
Use "\mathcal{ }" for a caligraphic font
Use "\mathbb{ }" for a blackboard bold font
